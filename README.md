SamlSPBundle
============

Currently under development.
It is not recommended to use this bundle in any way but to explore SAML integration in symfony.
When it reaches beta phase documentation will be written.

Any issue that is observed and reported is highly appreciated.

Thanks to fos/user-bundle and fp/openid-bundle open source projects that helped understand better how symfony2
security works and learn how custom security extensions should be built.
